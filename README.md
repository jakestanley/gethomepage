# gethomepage

Configuration for my [gethomepage](http://gethomepage.dev) setup.

Used by [my server docker compose setup](https://github.com/jakestanley/docker/tree/e3442ecc5edb55d98b52e2bdb854dc98d21e2641/arch_x86/qbittorrent) and this config relies upon that providing the `homepage.secrets` env file

Secrets can be added to `settings.yaml` so the default was committed for compatibility but changes will not be detected in the work tree thanks to [this stack overflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/39776107)
